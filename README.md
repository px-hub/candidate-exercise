# The People Experience Hub Coding Exercise

### Introduction to the React Coding Exercise

Welcome to this coding exercise, where you will demonstrate your skills in building a modern front-end application using React and industry-standard libraries. The goal of this exercise is to assess your knowledge and ability to create a performant and maintainable web application that meets industry best practices.

### Objective

Using the template provided, your task is to develop a front-end application that allows users to interact with a set of blog posts. The application should be responsive, intuitive, and efficient. You will be evaluated on your ability to:

1. Implement core React principles: Utilize functional components, hooks, and state management effectively.
2. Use industry-standard libraries: Integrate libraries such as React Router for navigation, Redux or Context API for state management, and Axios or Fetch API for data fetching.
3. Ensure scalability and performance: Write clean, modular, and reusable code that can scale as the application grows. Optimize performance where necessary, considering aspects like lazy loading, memoization, and efficient rendering.
4. Follow best practices: Adhere to best practices in code structure, styling (using CSS-in-JS, CSS modules, or similar), and testing.

### Requirements

1. User Interface: Create a user-friendly interface with a list and detail view of blog posts. Users should be able to:
   - View a list of posts.
   - Click on each post to view the blog post.
   - Navigate between pages seamlessly.
2. Data Handling:
   - Create and update existing functions to Fetch data from a provided API endpoint.
   - Handle loading states, error states, and empty states appropriately.
3. State Management:
   - Ensure that state updates are handled efficiently and correctly.
4. Routing:
   - Implement client-side routing using React Router.
   - Ensure that navigation is smooth and that the correct data is displayed based on the URL.
5. Performance Optimization:
   - Use techniques such as code splitting and lazy loading to ensure the application performs well, even with a large data set.
6. Testing:
   - Write unit tests for your components using a testing library like Jest or React Testing Library.
   - Ensure your application has a high test coverage and that the tests are meaningful.

### Evaluation Criteria

- Functionality: The application meets all the functional requirements specified.
- Code Quality: The code is clean, well-organized, and follows industry best practices.
- Scalability: The application is designed to scale with an increasing amount of data and complexity.
- Performance: The application performs well, with minimal lag or delay in rendering.
- User Experience: The user interface is intuitive, responsive, and visually appealing.
- Testing: The application includes meaningful tests with high coverage.

### Getting Started

1.  Clone the repo
2.  Install Dependencies: Run npm install to install the necessary dependencies.
3.  Start Development: Run npm start to start the development server and begin coding.

### Additional Hints

1. Spend time to review the existing architecture
2. Begin with updating the existing mockAPI function to retrieve data
3. Attempt to add loaders for components to access the data
4. Write components to receive data as props
5. Display data

Good luck, and happy coding!
